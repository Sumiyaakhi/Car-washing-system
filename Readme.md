# This is a Node js backend project where I used TypeScript, express.js, mongoose, mongodb on node.js.

# To run this project :

- Firstly you have to copy the live url link which is
  (https://assignment-3-sepia-six.vercel.app/
  )and after that paste on the postman or any other sites.

- Then you should be added api/auth, api/services, api/slots, api/bookings or api/my-bookings for the others route name like
  (https://assignment-3-sepia-six.vercel.app/auth)
  (https://assignment-3-sepia-six.vercel.app/services )
  (https://assignment-3-sepia-six.vercel.app/slots )
  (https://assignment-3-sepia-six.vercel.app/bookings )
  (https://assignment-3-sepia-six.vercel.app/my-bookings )

- After using this route , you can see the database's data and also can get, post, put, delete from CRUD operation.

- And if you sign in as a role for admin, you can access the admin routes from the database using token(add Bearer in front of token in Authorization in header part).
- If u want to sign in as a user, then as like admin you also have to authenticate by using token(add Bearer in front of token in Authorization in header part).

....................Thank You.................
