# This is a Node js backend project where I used TypeScript, express.js, mongoose, mongodb on node.js.

# To run this project :

- Firstly you have to copy the live url link which is
  (https://assignment-2-sand-two.vercel.app/
  )and after that paste on the postman or any other sites.

- Then you should be added api/products or api/orders for the others route name like
  (https://assignment-2-sand-two.vercel.app/api/products)
  (https://assignment-2-sand-two.vercel.app/api/orders )

- After using this route , you can see the database's data and also can get, post, put, delete from CRUD operation.
